title: Intro-Speciation(2004)
description: Speciation, published in 2004, is a landmark book that provides a unified
  and comprehensive overview of research in the field. While some of its content may
  now be considered outdated in 2025, it undeniably remains a valuable framework for
  understanding the major themes and questions that have shaped speciation studies.
  The introduction offers a concise review of three major phases in speciation research,
  tracing developments from Darwin’s The Origin of Species (1859) to contemporary
  work up to 2004, and highlighting how scientific perspectives on species have evolved
  over time.

By the time when this book was published in 2004, developments of works on speciation can be divided into three phases:

1. 1859 - 1900s: *The Origin of Species* (Darwin, 1859). 
2. 1900s - 1980s
3. 1980s -

Darwin’s ideas on the origin of species were influenced by Malthus’s theory [1], particularly the notion that the disparity between the tendency for overpopulation and the limitation of available resources leads to famine and disease, which in turn reduce populations to sustainable levels. Darwin proposed that new species arise through natural selection acting on variation within overpopulating populations. However, this view appears to conflate two distinct processes: **adaptation**, where species evolve toward fitness peaks, and **speciation**, which involves the emergence of new reproductive barriers that give rise to distinct species.
